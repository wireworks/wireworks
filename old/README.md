[Wireworks](https://wireworks.github.io) is a set of tools and demos created to help learning, understanding and exploring computer networking.

This project uses Sass and Typescript. In order to compile Sass to CSS, run the following command:

    sass sass:css
    
In order to compile Typescript to Javascript, simply run:

    tsc

You may use their watchers as well (flags `-w` for TS and `--watch` for Sass).
